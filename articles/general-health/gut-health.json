Your gut health is connected with major organs and systems, and protecting your gut is important at any age to keep you safe from several health conditions. Read on to learn further about gut health and understand how to improve gut health.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is gut health?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maintaining your gut health means having loads of healthy gut bacteria and other microbes in your digestive tract. It can boost digestion, uplift your mood, and strengthen your immune system. It is also one of the fundamental requirements for a healthy heart and brain.\u00a0</span></p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Additional Read:\u00a0</span></strong><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.bajajfinservhealth.in/articles/yoga-for-digestion-4-best-poses-to-boost-your-metabolism-today\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How can yoga for digestion help boost your metabolism?</span></a><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is the gut microbiome? Know how it affects your health</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The bacteria and other microorganisms found in our digestive tract are commonly referred to as the gut microbiome. Note that human beings have around 200 types of fungi, viruses and bacteria present in their digestive tract [1]. All of them are not beneficial, but some of them are crucial to maintaining a healthy body. Studies also reflect that diverse kinds of bacteria in your gut can help you prevent conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and diabetes [2].</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Research over the years has also found a connection between gut health with the following factors:\u00a0</span></p><ul> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cancer</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Heart disease</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Endocrine disorders</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mental health conditions</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Immunity</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Autoimmune conditions</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Gastrointestinal disorders [3]</span></li></ul><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If the diversity of the gut microbiome is high, it may reflect your health is in good condition. However, while further research is on this topic, it is evident that the condition of your gut health affects your other systems and overall health.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Good bacteria and bad bacteria in your gut</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Among the gut microbiome, there are good bacteria and bad ones. Remember, good bacteria are usually referred to as probiotics. Common good bacteria which play a key role in improving gut health include Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterial, and more. On the other hand, bad bacteria in your gut may lead to different types of health conditions. They can also be a risk factor for accelerated biological ageing. Typical bad bacteria that may exist in your gut include E. coli, Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, and more.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Signs of unhealthy gut</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Different symptoms can reflect an unhealthy gut. Let's take a look at them:</span></p><ul> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An upset stomach with associated symptoms such as diarrhoea, gas, heartburn, constipation, and bloating</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Short sleep duration that leads to extreme fatigue</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Unplanned and sudden weight loss or weight gain</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Autoimmune diseases affecting your digestive system</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Intolerance to certain foods, such as lactose intolerance</span></li> \t<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Irritation in your skin</span></li></ul><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to improve gut health: 7 top home remedies</span></h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Check if you have an intolerance to certain foods</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you feel unwell after eating certain foods every time, it may indicate food intolerance. Usual symptoms of food intolerance include diarrhoea, bloating, acid reflux, flatulence, nausea, stomach ache, and more. If you can identify the foods that cause intolerance, you can avoid them for some time to check whether symptoms improve. However, if they persist and keep hampering your gut health, it is best to consult your doctor as soon as possible.</span></p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Additional Read:\u00a0</span></strong><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.bajajfinservhealth.in/articles/healthy-eating-habits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Healthy Food Habits: Avoid These 11 Food Habits to Stay Fit</span></a><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Switch to a balanced and nutritious diet</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sometimes, you may need to completely change your diet plan for balanced gut health. To do that, you may eliminate foods that are processed and high in fats or sugar. Opting for a high-fibre diet can be prudent for a healthy gut microbiome. You can also include gut-healthy foods like fruits and vegetables in your diet to keep your gut health at the optimum level.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Manage your stress through effective techniques</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">High levels of stress can impact your gut health, so it is important to keep it as low as possible. For that, you can opt for walking, meditation, laughter, yoga, massage, and more. You can also prioritize practices such as spending sufficient time with family and friends, diffusing essential oils into the air, avoiding or limiting alcohol consumption, and adopting a pet for best results.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Take your time to eat</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Don't hurry while eating to avoid potential gut issues. It is important to chew your foods well before swallowing them. With this, you can avoid potential gut discomforts. Eating your meals slowly also helps you to prevent health risks such as diabetes and obesity.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Consume a prebiotic or probiotic</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Studies have already established that adding a prebiotic or probiotic to your diet can be highly beneficial for your gut health. While prebiotics act as foods for the bacteria in your gut, probiotics are bacteria themselves. However, probiotics are not recommended if you have serious health conditions or a weak immune system. Also, remember all probiotic supplements don't have sufficient health value. Consult your doctor to understand which probiotic supplements can work best for you.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Maintain a balanced sleep cycle</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is important to sleep for a minimum of 7-8 hours per night to maintain the health of your gut and other systems. Gut problems from lack of sleep may lead to sleep issues and other health problems.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Drink plenty of water</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Staying hydrated is key to maintaining the diversity of bacteria in your gut. However, the source of drinking water also matters in this regard. Researchers have discovered that people drinking more water usually have less quantity of bad bacteria in their gut. As a result, such people have less chance of getting gastrointestinal infections.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Conclusion</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With all this information about maintaining and improving gut health at your disposal, now you can effectively maintain a diverse gut microbiome. If you are facing any severe gut-related issues or have some concerns about gut health, you can consult a doctor at Bajaj Finserv Health.
